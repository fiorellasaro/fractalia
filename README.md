## 🌿 Fractals in Nature

Fractals are not just abstract mathematical concepts; they are the geometry of nature. Many natural objects exhibit **self-similarity**, where smaller parts resemble the whole.

### 1. Ferns

Ferns are a classic example of self-similarity in nature. Each frond is composed of smaller sub-fronds (pinnae), which are in turn composed of even smaller leaflets (pinnules), all mimicking the shape of the entire frond.

### 2. Romanesco Broccoli

Perhaps the most visually striking edible fractal, the Romanesco broccoli displays a logarithmic spiral structure. Each bud is composed of a series of smaller buds arranged in a spiral, continuing down to microscopic levels.

### 3. Snowflakes

Snowflakes form via crystallization patterns that branch out symmetrically. While not infinite like mathematical fractals, their branching arms (dendrites) show recursive growth patterns similar to the Koch Snowflake.
